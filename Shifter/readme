CPU Shifter

It needs to do 3 things: 
 - Shift (to) left logical (SLL)
 - Shift (to) right logical (SRL)
 - Shift (to) right arithmetic (SRA)

The value to be shifted is from “input data” (32bits) and “shift by” (5bits) determines how much the value should be shifted.
The direction is (left or right) is from funct3: 0b001 is SLL, 0b101 is SRL and 0b101 is SRA.
Don’t be confused that SRL and SRA have the same funct3 code, this last thing is from the “I” input:
if I is high, it will do a SRA, if low, It will do SRL. “I” input is not relevant is SLL operations
